CRITICAL WARNING: [Route 35-39] The design did not meet timing requirements. Please run report_timing_summary for detailed reports.
Resolution: Verify that the timing was met or had small violations at all previous steps (synthesis, placement, power_opt, and phys_opt). Run report_timing_summary and analyze individual timing paths.
INFO: [Route 35-253] TNS is the sum of the worst slack violation on every endpoint in the design. Review the paths with the biggest WNS violations in the timing reports and modify your constraints or your design to improve both WNS and TNS.
