REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 im_inst/mem_reg_0 has an input control pin im_inst/mem_reg_0/ENARDEN (net: im_inst/mem_reg_0_ENARDEN_cooolgate_en_sig_1) which is driven by a register (uart_inst/prog_mode_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#2 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 im_inst/mem_reg_0 has an input control pin im_inst/mem_reg_0/ENARDEN (net: im_inst/mem_reg_0_ENARDEN_cooolgate_en_sig_1) which is driven by a register (uart_inst/wr_en_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-1839#3 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 im_inst/mem_reg_0 has an input control pin im_inst/mem_reg_0/RSTRAMB (net: im_inst/prog_mode) which is driven by a register (uart_inst/prog_mode_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

REQP-1839#4 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 im_inst/mem_reg_0 has an input control pin im_inst/mem_reg_0/WEA[0] (net: im_inst/wr_en) which is driven by a register (uart_inst/wr_en_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset.
